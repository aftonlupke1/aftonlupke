<h1>ABOUT</h1>
<p><h2>How large is the problem? Studies show that up to five million children in the United States experience and/or witness domestic violence each year. Whether itâ€™s watching an act of physical or sexual abuse, listening to threats or sounds of violence, or viewing the evidence of such abuse in a victim in the signs of bleeding, bruises, torn clothing, or broken items, the effects are damaging to a child, in a variety of ways. Children in our nation are suffering from an epidemic of child abuse from those who proclaim to love them the most. Indeed, witnessing domestic abuse can also be traumatic for a child.</h2></p>

<h1>1.Raise Awareness</h1>

<p><h3>Knowledge is power, and awareness brings advocacy. Educate those around you about the realities of domestic abuse and
violence. Whether it is where you work, where you exercise, where you practice your faith, or where your own circle of
friends and family are, inform and educate them about this issue. When those around you become aware of the realities of
domestic violence among children, they become advocates, as well.</h3></p>

<h1>2. Organize your Community</h1>

<p><h3>Faith based organizations, civic groups, schools, community leaders, and local and state legislatures can all come together to both fight child abuse. Contact these organizations and individuals and organize meetings with them, as well as with your local law enforcement. Create a child abuse prevention team in your area, and in your city.</h3></p>
